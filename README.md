Cocos SearchPaths
===

[Cocos2d-x](http://cocos2d-x.org/) helping tools to work with search paths.

Due to the lack of features to manipulate the resources paths, manly when using different resolutions, translations etc,
this tool was developed. 

It's intention is to help easy creation of resources paths based on variants like resolution, translations and any
others.
